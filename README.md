ðŸŒ² Forest Cover Type Classification

This project focuses on predicting the forest cover type using a variety of cartographic and environmental features available in the UCI Covertype dataset. The dataset consists of multiple attributes such as elevation, slope, aspect, soil type, and other geographical indicators, which are used to classify different types of forest cover. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, preprocess it effectively, and build robust machine learning models capable of handling multi-class classification problems.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps Involved

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Loaded the Covertype dataset and handled missing values and outliers.

Processed categorical features such as soil type and wilderness areas using encoding techniques.

Scaled numerical features to bring them to the same range for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed visualization of key features to understand their distribution.

Analyzed relationships between elevation, slope, and forest cover type.

Identified feature importance to select relevant variables for training.

Model Training and Evaluation

Implemented multiple multi-class classification models.

Focused primarily on tree-based algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost, since they are well-suited for handling large feature sets and categorical variables.

Used a confusion matrix and classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score) to evaluate model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Applied GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize key hyperparameters such as learning rate, depth, and number of estimators.

Improved model accuracy and reduced overfitting by fine-tuning these parameters.

Visualization and Insights

Visualized the confusion matrix to identify classes that were harder to predict.

Analyzed feature importance to understand which environmental variables played the most significant role in predicting forest cover type.
